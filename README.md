# WQAchievements
Would you like to be alerted when a certain world quest is available?

This addon can alert you when a world quest is up that is needed for an achievement.
But wait - there's more! It can also let you know about world quests that award mounts, pets, reputation, currency, toys, item upgrades... You can even enter in a custom world quest or reward to watch for that might not be in the settings. It watches for both Legion and Battle for Azeroth world quests.

Additionally it tracks emissaries and mission tables from Warlords of Draenor, Legion and Battle for Azeroth.

You'll get notifications either in your chat or as a separate window. You can also click on the mini map icon or write the following command to show the table with the world quests:
```
/wqa
```
